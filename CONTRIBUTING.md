Thank you for considering a contribution to **VastVoid**. This project welcomes pull requests and issues that improve the codebase or documentation.

## Commit message guidelines

Clear commit history helps others follow the evolution of the project. When crafting commit messages please follow these guidelines:

- **Title**: use a short descriptive summary (50 characters or fewer). Keep it in the imperative mood, e.g. `Add autopilot`.
- **Blank line**: insert a blank line after the title.
- **Body**: explain _what_ changed and _why_. Mention any relevant issue numbers. Wrap lines at roughly 72 characters.
- **Descriptive content**: provide enough context in both the title and body so future readers understand the purpose of the commit.

Adhering to these conventions makes the commit history easier to navigate and review.
